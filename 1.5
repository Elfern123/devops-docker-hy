Outside the container:

PS C:\Users\User1> docker run -it --name testi2 ubuntu:16.04 sh -c "echo 'Input website:'; read website; echo 'Searching..'; sleep 1; curl http://$website;"
Input website:
helsinki.fi
Searching..
curl: (6) Could not resolve host: http

Inside the container: 

apt-get update
apt-get install -y curl

I know this should work, but for some reason it does not. It seems like either the " or ' characters are not working properly in the script-part with Windows, or the // in the address.
I tried the address with escaping (////) but it did not work, and different combinations of " and ' did not either. Using curl inside the container works perfectly fine, so the issue isn't there either. Also in exercise 1.7 this worked just fine (again, because I don't have to input the script into powershell console...)
